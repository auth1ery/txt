<h1>txt terms of service</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 11, 2026</p>
<hr>
<p>By using txt, you agree that you are over the age of 13+ and that you will follow the rules down below.</p>
<p>We do not allow hate speech, illegal content, spam, phishing links, and harassment towards people. Doing so will get you reported and possibly banned.</p>
<p>Breaking the filter or attacking the servers/site will leave you IP banned indefinitely.</p>
<p>Moderators and other people in charge have all rights and have the final say all over banning accounts. We also have the rights to delete content, whatever if it's a comment or a post.</p>
<p>However, users have full rights to their content and cannot be copied or distributed and it can be only us who can display the content. We can delete your content if we have to.</p>
<p>The site is provided "as-is" and may have downtime, shortages, or shutdowns.</p>
<p>You are responsible for what you post, just have common sense when it comes to posting and commenting and talking. We're not liable if the site goes down or someone does something stupid. We are humans running a small platform... not a giant corporation with infinite resources.</p>
<p>We have the right to modify ToS anytime, and anywhere. We also have the right to indefinitely ban people off our platform.</p>
<p>Generative AI content is extremely prohibited, whatever if it's text or anything else. Any use of Generative AI will result in a ban.</p>
<p>Engagement farming is extremely prohibited. Any selling of accounts is also prohibited. If content is misinformation, it will get "fact checked" by moderators, admins, and volunteers.</p>
