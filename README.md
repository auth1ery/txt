# install

you typlically need to just run:

```npm install```

this alone will install:
- pg (PostgreSQL client for Node.js)
- express (web framework)
from package.json.

cant install from that command? then you'll need to manually install node.js and postgreSQL from these websites:
https://nodejs.org
https://postgresql.org

after when you install the requirements, you can just run:

```npm start```

thats it!
